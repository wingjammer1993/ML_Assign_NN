    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you'll implement a general feed-forward neural network class that utilizes sigmoid activation functions. Your tasks will be to implement `forward propagation`, `prediction`, `back propagation`, `gradient_checking`, and a general `train` routine to learn the weights in your network via Stochastic Gradient Descent.  \n",

    "The skeleton for the `Network` class is below. Note that this class is almost identical to the one you worked with in the **Lecture 18** in-class notebook, so you should look there to remind yourself of the details.   Scroll down to find more information about your tasks as well as unit tests. \n",

    "**Important Note**: In **Problem 2** we'll be using the `Network` class to train a network to do handwritten digit recognition.  Please make sure to utilize vectorized Numpy routines as much as possible, as writing inefficient code here will cause very slow training times in **Problem 2**. "
